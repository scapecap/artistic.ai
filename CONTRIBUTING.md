# Contributing to ArtisticAI

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ArtisticAI. It's people like you that make ArtisticAI such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Getting Started

Before you begin:
- Have you read the code of conduct?
- Check out the existing issues & see if we accept contributions for your type of issue.

Contributions to ArtisticAI are made to the following types of assets:
- Code
- Documentation
- Design

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to ArtisticAI? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

## Code Contribution

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain ArtisticAI's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible ArtisticAI
- Enable a sustainable system for ArtisticAI's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:
1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for ArtisticAI. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- Check the debugging guide — you might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix it yourself.
- Determine [which repository](https://github.com/ArtisticAI) the problem should be reported in.
- Check if the issue has already been reported — if it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### How To Submit A Good Bug Report

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Python Styleguide

Use the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code.

### Documentation Styleguide

Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for documentation.
